# Recycle It/Switch 2 Sustainability

</br>

## üöÄ Introduction
Recycle It is a prototype app based on a start-up Idea by team dotSlashByte built on Start-a-thon. The idea is to collect and recycle used wastes such as plastic, scrap metals and other non-biodegradables from every source possible from everyday households and small businesses to large industries, factories and hotels and then provide the recycled products to the big industries, mainly use recycled products and to the small companies.
</br>
## ‚ôªÔ∏è How it works?
Our innovative project focuses on addressing the issue of non-biodegradable waste, primarily plastics, through a dual approach catering to both B2B and B2C sectors. Our core concept involves procuring non-biodegradable waste from major industrial entities and everyday households. After that, we plan to recycle these materials at dedicated recycling facilities. By doing so, we can supply the resultant recycled goods to businesses of all scales, which heavily rely on recycled non-biodegradable materials. These businesses include renowned names like Neeman's, TerraCycle, Garnier, and WeWood. By offering these recycled resources at competitive prices, our project contributes to a cleaner environment and mitigates the excessive use of plastic. Additionally, the initiative promotes the growth of small enterprises within a fiercely competitive market landscape.
